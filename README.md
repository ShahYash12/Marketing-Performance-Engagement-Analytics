# 📊 Marketing Performance & Engagement Analysis  
**Exploratory Data Analysis & Behavioral Insights Project**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project performs an **end-to-end marketing performance and engagement analysis** using digital analytics data to evaluate **traffic quality, user engagement, and behavioral patterns** across different acquisition channels and time periods.

Rather than focusing only on total traffic, the analysis emphasizes **engaged vs non-engaged sessions**, helping identify which channels drive **meaningful user interactions** and which contribute to low-quality traffic.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis was designed to answer key business and marketing questions:

- Which acquisition channels drive **high-quality engagement**, not just volume?
- Where is traffic failing to engage meaningfully?
- How does engagement vary by **channel** and **time of day**?
- Which channels should be optimized, scaled, or deprioritized?

These insights support **marketing optimization, funnel improvement, and growth strategy decisions**.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Identified categorical and numeric features
- Converted performance metrics to numeric values while handling missing or malformed data
- Parsed datetime fields and extracted **hour-level granularity**
- Standardized column handling to ensure reliable aggregations

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created a derived metric for **Non-Engaged Sessions**:
- - Enabled direct comparison between traffic **quality vs quantity**
- Engineered time-based features to analyze hourly behavior patterns

### 3. Aggregation & Channel-Level Analysis
- Grouped data by **channel group**
- Aggregated total sessions and engaged sessions per channel
- Calculated non-engaged sessions to reveal inefficiencies
- Reshaped data for comparative visualization

### 4. Visualization & Insight Generation
- Visualized **Engaged vs Non-Engaged Sessions** by channel
- Highlighted relative engagement efficiency across acquisition sources
- Used visual storytelling to surface actionable patterns

## 📈 Key Results & Insights

- Identified **clear engagement disparities across channels**, where some sources generated high traffic but low engagement.
- Revealed channels with **strong engagement efficiency**, indicating higher-quality users and better retention potential.
- Quantified **non-engaged traffic**, uncovering hidden inefficiencies not visible from session counts alone.
- Observed **time-based engagement trends**, enabling future optimization of campaign timing and user experience.
